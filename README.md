# Learning Astro (a "meta-framework")

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

The idea: any JS framework --> output and serve just HTML. (Plus only the JS you need, when you need it.)

React and Vue and Svelte and Vanilla JS, etc. =(Astro)=> native HTML + JS

- default = no client-side JS by default on components
- `client:load` = immediately/always hydrate component with JS
- `client:idle` = when you're free
- `client:visible` = when visible

## From scratch

npm install
npm start # http://localhost:3000/
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Tour.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run start` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
